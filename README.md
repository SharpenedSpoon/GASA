# Goon Aeronautics and Space Administration

Welcome to the future of goon living: in space, one at a time, in a video game.

## Instructions

Make a folder in KSP's saves directory called "GASA", house this repo in there.

## Guidelines

Do stuff. Try to avoid putting any modded parts on crafts - at least until 1.1 is out officially and we agree on mods to use. Leaving other mods installed (even ones that add scenarios and/or affect gameplay) seems to be fine and not cause issues, with the only caveat that it's possible progress could be lost.
